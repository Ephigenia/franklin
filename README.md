# DESCRIPTION

Franklin is a very basic PHP5-script that collects data from various tests that
youâ€™ve configured from websites and services for a later display as charts in a
report page.

# REQUIREMENTS

* PHP 5.2 or later
* PHP Curl module (e.g. "php5-curl" package) 

# INSTALLATION

1. copy all files into an extra directory in your webspace
2. make the directory `/data` writable by the user running cron.php (see below)
3. edit `/config/config.php` to your own desires
4. create a cron job that calls cron.php periodically (e.g. every 10mins)  
   example: `*/10 * * * * user  php5 -f /path/to/cron.php 2>&1 > /dev/null`
5. open the Franklin root directory in your webbrowser to see the reports
